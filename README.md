# 🎯 Focus Flow Pro

**Focus Flow Pro** is a high-performance productivity Chrome Extension designed to help users reclaim their focus. Unlike traditional blockers that just stop you from visiting a site, Focus Flow uses "Gentle Nudges" like grayscale, blurring, and transparency to discourage mindless scrolling.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Custom Site Limits:** Set specific time limits (Hours, Minutes, Seconds) for any distracting website.
- **Deep Work Mode 🔥:** A high-stakes mode that disables the "Snooze" button to force absolute focus.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** A dedicated full-page dashboard with interactive **Chart.js** visualizations.
  - **Line Chart:** Track your total wasted time trends over the last 30 days.
  - **Doughnut Chart:** See exactly which sites are stealing most of your time.
- **Dark Mode Support:** A beautiful, eye-friendly dark theme for late-night productivity sessions.
- **Accountability Grading:** Get a daily "Productivity Grade" (A+ to F) based on your performance.
- **CSV Export:** Download your rules and data for external time-tracking analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **JavaScript (Manifest V3):** Using modern Chrome Extension standards.
- **Chrome Storage API:** Efficiently handles both `sync` (rules) and `local` (large history data).
- **Chart.js:** For high-end data visualization.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Modern layouts with Flexbox, CSS Grid, and custom animations.
